This is the repository for my RH Cluster Suite talk that I am planning to give
in April 2011.

If you wish to use this yourself, you will have to read the code.  It's not
complicated at all though, so you should be fine.

There are 2 files to be concerned with, and an iso (not provided).

On a machine with the appropriate virtualization extensions on the processor,
install Centos5.5 (Or any GNU/Linux flavor capable of running KVM).  After the
installation, if you did not select the virtualization pacjage set, then you
will want to install kvm.  Next install apache (you will need this for the
kickstart tomfoolery.  Alternatively, any of the other kickstart methods will
work, but my example here uses http).

The script also makes use of LVM, and it's snap shot capabilites to speed up
the creation of Virtual Machines.

If this is a fresh install, first check out the codez

  git clone git://github.com/slaney/cluster-suite-talk.git

Then cd into the cluster-suite-talk directory.  Now move the tmpl_ks.cgf
(kickstart file) to a web accessible directory.

Now, create the template

  make-cluster -t

Then create the nodes

  make-cluster -n
